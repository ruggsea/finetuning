      " When apprised in 1936 of Turing's idea for a universal machine, Turing's contemporary and friend, the economist David Champernowne, reacted by saying that such a thing was impractical; it would need ‘the Albert Hall.’ If built from relays as then employed in telephone exchanges, that might indeed have been so, and Turing made no attempt at it. However, in 1937 Turing did work with relays on a smaller machine with a special cryptological function . World history then led Turing to his unique role in the Enigma problem, to his becoming the chief figure in the mechanisation of logical procedures, and to his being introduced to ever faster and more ambitious technology as the war continued. \n",
      "\n",
      " After 1942, Turing learnt that electronic components offered the speed, storage capacity and logical functions required to be effective as ‘tapes’ and instruction tables. So from 1945, Turing tried to use electronics to turn his universal machine into practical reality. Turing rapidly composed a detailed plan for a modern stored-program computer: that is, a computer in which data and instructions are stored and manipulated alike. Turing's ideas led the field, although his report of 1946 postdated von Neumann's more famous EDVAC report . It can however be argued, as does Davis , that von Neumann gained his fundamental insight into the computer through his pre-war familiarity with Turing's logical work. At the time, however, these basic principles were not much discussed. The difficulty of engineering the electronic hardware dominated everything.\n",
      "\n",
      " It therefore escaped observers that Turing was ahead of von Neumann and everyone else on the future of software, or as he called it, the ‘construction of instruction tables.’ Turing  foresaw at once: Instruction tables will have to be made up by mathematicians with computing experiences and perhaps a certain puzzle-solving ability. There will probably be a great deal of work to be done, for every known process has got to be translated into instruction table form at some stage. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " The process of constructing instruction tables should be very fascinating. There need be no real danger of it ever becoming a drudge, for any processes that are quite mechanical may be turned over to the machine itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " These remarks, reflecting the universality of the computer, and its ability to manipulate its own instructions, correctly described the future trajectory of the computer industry. However, Turing had in mind something greater: ‘building a brain.’\"\n",

      "Professor: answer\n",
      " Student: I've heard Turing was a genius, but what made his ideas so groundbreaking?\n",
      "\n",
      "Professor: Well, imagine you're in a library—a vast one like the Library of Congress. Turing's idea of a universal machine is like having a librarian who can not only find any book you want but also read and follow any set of instructions in any of those books. Before Turing, we had many machines that could do specific tasks, like a calculator for adding numbers. But his universal machine, much like our modern computers, could theoretically perform any computable task given the right instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Student: So, why didn't he just build it then?\n",
      "\n",
      "Professor: Ah, that's where practicality comes in. At the time, building such a machine would have required an enormous amount of space and resources. Imagine trying to fit all the functionality of a modern computer into a machine made from telephone relays—it would be like trying to squeeze an entire orchestra into a closet! But Turing didn't let that stop him from exploring the concept and eventually working towards its realization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Student: How did he go from theory to practice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Professor: World War II played a significant role in that. Turing worked on decoding the Enigma machine, which sharpened his skills in applying logical procedures to real-world problems. After the war, he learned about electronics and realized that electronic components could provide the speed and storage capacity his universal machine needed. It's like finding a better tool for the job—if you've been digging with a spoon, discovering a shovel will make your task much easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Student: But wasn't there someone else involved in computer development? I think I've heard of von Neumann.\n",
      "\n",
      "Professor: Indeed, von Neumann is often credited with the concept of the modern computer. However, there's a strong argument to be made that his insights were influenced by Turing's pre-war work. While von Neumann's report on the EDVAC is more famous, Turing's report on a stored-program computer came soon after and was equally visionary. It's like having two artists painting the same landscape—one might become more famous, but both contribute to the artistic canon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Student: What did Turing see for the future of computers?\n",
      "\n",
      "Professor: Turing foresaw the need for what we now call software—instruction tables that tell the computer what to do. He envisioned mathematicians and puzzle-solvers creating these instructions, much like how we have programmers today. But he also saw beyond just creating instructions; he imagined the computer manipulating its own instructions, learning, and even \"building a brain.\" It's like he wasn’t just designing a car but envisioning a future where the car could drive itself and even improve its driving over time.\n"
